###sample coding test


## print hello world


### write a function that prints squares of a sequence of numbers



#### write a function that prints the sum of three numbers


### for a string of numbers, print the square values

## apply a # from random uniform distribution to 5 slots, 0 to 10

### write a function that prints the half of each number in a vector
## if the number is < 10


### write a loop that populates a data frame

## write a function that will print "fizz" if it is divisible by 3 and 5, and "buzz" if only by 5, and the i integer if not

##create an empty data frame with employee information, and then write a function to find the maximum grouped by for columns


## use that same data frame to group by region or city and then find the mean for each
